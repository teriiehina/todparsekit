# ParseKit #

## About ##
ParseKit is a Mac OS X Framework written by Todd Ditchendorf in Objective-C 2.0 and released under the MIT Open Source License. ParseKit is suitable for use on Mac OS X Leopard or iPhone OS. The framework is an Objective-C implementation of the tools described in "Building Parsers with Java" by Steven John Metsker. ParseKit includes additional features beyond the designs from the book and also some changes to match common Cocoa/Objective-C conventions. However, these changes are relatively superficial, and Metsker's book is the best documentation available for this framework.

Active development is constantly happening in Head of trunk. If you are looking for a stable checkout of the framework, the latest tagged release (in the '/tags' directory) is recommended.
